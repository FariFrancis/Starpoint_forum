This project is a website that is made with the purpose of having a forum site. The primary and intended use is discussion around the economy and to facilitate this, there is an API page designed with every current exchange rate from USD. It can be used for other discussions, however this is what the design is intended for and more implementations will be made so that more conversations can happen as well as be welcomed. Users can make an account that will have a protected password from injection techniques and encrypted before being stored. There is a signup, login and logout method in place and logging in returns users to their dashboard. Some improvements that need to be made from this point are improving the CSS as well as adding more protection and methods to interact with the site. The logins are managed by sessions which means there is no backtrack exploits to see someones account information, however there is an issue with sessions lasting infinitely, which means that adjustments will be made for hour long intervals to automatically sign out users if no action is being taken.
